    <h1>7 Practical Productivity Tips for Busy Professionals</h1>
    <p>Productivity is not about squeezing more tasks into an already packed day. It is about protecting attention, choosing the right next action, and creating systems that make good decisions automatic. The following seven tips are practical, low-friction, and designed to work whether you manage a team, build a business, or simply want calmer days.</p>

    <h2>1) Start with a daily intention</h2>
    <p>Before opening your inbox, write a one-sentence intention: “Today will be successful if I …”. This defines success for the day and prevents your agenda from being hijacked by other people’s priorities. Keep the statement visible while you work.</p>

    <h2>2) Use short, named blocks</h2>
    <p>Rather than vague calendar entries like “work”, block 25–50 minutes for specific outcomes: “Draft client email”, “Review Q3 roadmap”, or “Fix navbar bug”. Specific blocks reduce resistance and make it clear when to stop.</p>

    <h2>3) Batch communication</h2>
    <p>Notifications splinter attention. Check email and messaging at scheduled times—perhaps late morning and late afternoon. Outside those blocks, keep tools closed. People quickly adapt when you respond consistently.</p>

    <h2>4) Switch to single-task mode</h2>
    <p>Multitasking is a myth. When a task matters, close extra tabs, put your phone in another room, and work with one window visible. Even a ten-minute single-task sprint can finish items that otherwise linger all day.</p>

    <h2>5) Plan the next step, not the whole project</h2>
    <p>Projects stall because the next step is unclear. Replace “Finish report” with “Outline three sections” or “Collect two data points”. Every task in Today’s Tasks should be a visible next step that can be completed in one sitting.</p>

    <h2>6) Create small finish lines</h2>
    <p>Momentum is addictive. Break work into chunks that end with a visible win—a saved file, a shipped pull request, or a message sent. Reward yourself with a short walk or water break when a chunk is done.</p>

    <h2>7) Review briefly, daily</h2>
    <p>End the day by scanning what moved and what didn’t. Archive completed items, reschedule the rest, and choose tomorrow’s top three. A two-minute review prevents the buildup of stale tasks and creates a calm start the next morning.</p>

    <h2>Bring it together with Today’s Tasks</h2>
    <p>Our tool exists to make these habits easy: capture the next action, mark priorities, and clear the list at midnight so you start fresh. The less time you spend managing tasks, the more time you spend doing meaningful work.</p>
