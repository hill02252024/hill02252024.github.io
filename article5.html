    <section class="group">
      <h2>Why a Weekly Review Matters</h2>
      <p>A weekly review helps you clear your mind, evaluate what worked, and set priorities for the week ahead. Without reflection, tasks pile up and productivity suffers.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="group">
      <h2>Step 1: Clear Completed Tasks</h2>
      <p>Archive tasks marked as complete. A clean slate keeps your list relevant and prevents clutter from distracting you.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="group">
      <h2>Step 2: Re-evaluate Priorities</h2>
      <p>Look at what’s left in High, Due Today, and General. Move items around if their urgency or importance has changed.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="group">
      <h2>Step 3: Capture Loose Ends</h2>
      <p>Think about emails, conversations, or projects from the past week. Write them down as new tasks so nothing gets forgotten.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="group">
      <h2>Step 4: Plan Top Three Goals</h2>
      <p>Decide on three outcomes that would make the coming week a success. These become your guiding priorities when the week gets busy.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="group">
      <h2>Step 5: Reflect and Improve</h2>
      <p>Ask yourself: What slowed me down? What boosted my progress? Small tweaks compound into big productivity gains over time.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="group">
      <h2>Bring It All Together</h2>
      <p>Use Today’s Tasks as the anchor for your review. The app’s simple lanes help you reset each week with clarity, focus, and momentum.</p>
