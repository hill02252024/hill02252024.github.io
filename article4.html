    <section class="group">
      <h2>Getting Started</h2>
      <p>Today's Tasks is designed to be simple and intuitive. No registration is required—just open the website and start organizing your day in seconds. Your tasks are saved directly in your browser’s local storage, which means they never leave your device.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="group">
      <h2>Adding Tasks</h2>
      <p>To add a task, type it into the input box at the top of the page, choose a priority (High, Due Today, or General), and click “Add Task.” Tasks instantly appear in their respective lists, ready to track.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="group">
      <h2>Organizing Priorities</h2>
      <p>Use the three lanes—High, Due Today, and General—to separate urgent work from ongoing responsibilities. High priority is for critical deadlines, Due Today helps you finish daily goals, and General keeps longer-term tasks visible.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="group">
      <h2>Completing and Restoring</h2>
      <p>Click the green checkmark to mark a task complete. Completed tasks move into a separate section where you can restore them anytime. This helps track progress without losing visibility.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="group">
      <h2>Automatic Reset</h2>
      <p>At midnight, the app automatically resets your daily tasks to keep your list clean. Important long-term items can easily be re-added the next day.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="group">
      <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
      <p>By keeping things simple, Today’s Tasks makes sure you spend less time managing your list and more time getting real work done. Whether you’re a student, professional, or freelancer, this app adapts to your workflow without distraction.</p>
