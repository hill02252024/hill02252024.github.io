    <h1>Time Management Strategies That Actually Work</h1>
    <p>Great time management is less about squeezing more into a calendar and more about matching the right work to the right moment. The strategies below are simple, sustainable, and designed for professionals who juggle competing priorities.</p>

    <h2>Design your day around energy</h2>
    <p>Schedule deep work during your personal peak—often the morning—and hold meetings or admin for low-energy periods. Protect peak hours with a “no-meeting” rule whenever possible.</p>

    <h2>Rank tasks with a simple matrix</h2>
    <p>Use a two-by-two lens: impact vs. effort. High-impact, low-effort tasks deserve immediate attention; low-impact, high-effort tasks should be questioned or deferred. Today’s Tasks lists can mirror these categories.</p>

    <h2>Make a realistic daily capacity</h2>
    <p>Decide your limit for meaningful tasks per day (for example, three significant items). When the list exceeds capacity, renegotiate commitments or move items to a later date. Scarcity creates focus.</p>

    <h2>Standardize recurring blocks</h2>
    <p>Batch similar work: 1:1s on Tuesdays, reviews on Thursdays, invoices on the last business day. Routines reduce switching costs and help others know when to reach you.</p>

    <h2>Pre-commit to shutdown</h2>
    <p>Pick a daily stop time. A predictable finish forces earlier choices, prevents perfectionism, and improves rest—ironically making you faster tomorrow.</p>

    <h2>Use constraints to end procrastination</h2>
    <p>When a task feels vague, set a 15-minute timer to produce a rough first pass. Constraints turn avoidance into motion and create material you can improve.</p>

    <h2>Weekly review to steer the ship</h2>
    <p>Once a week, scan goals, scan calendars, and decide the three outcomes that would make next week a win. Archive completed tasks and clear anything that no longer matters.</p>

    <h2>Tools support, not replace, decisions</h2>
    <p>Software cannot choose priorities for you, but it can remove friction. Today’s Tasks keeps focus on action: capture, prioritize, complete, and reset—so the system stays tidy without maintenance.</p>
