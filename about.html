    <h1>About Today's Tasks</h1>

    <section class="group">
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>We built Today’s Tasks to help busy professionals focus on meaningful work. Many tools are heavy and require sign-ups, teams, and integrations. Today’s Tasks takes the opposite approach: a fast, private, no-signup to-do list that runs entirely in your browser.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="group">
      <h2>What Makes It Different</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Zero setup:</strong> open the site and start typing—no accounts, no sync headaches.</li>
        <li><strong>Local-first:</strong> tasks are saved in your browser’s localStorage; your data stays on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Just enough structure:</strong> three lanes—High Priority, Due Today, and General—keep decisions simple.</li>
        <li><strong>Daily reset:</strong> at midnight your list clears so you start fresh, avoiding task bloat.</li>
        <li><strong>Accessible:</strong> readable typography and keyboard-friendly interactions.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="group">
      <h2>How We Think About Productivity</h2>
      <p>Productivity is about attention and momentum, not managing dozens of labels. We optimize for speed: capture the next visible step, choose a lane, and get moving. The less time you spend managing the tool, the more time you spend doing the work.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="group">
      <h2>Roadmap</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Optional export/import of tasks for backups.</li>
        <li>Light and dark themes.</li>
        <li>Keyboard shortcuts for power users.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">We keep the roadmap intentionally small to preserve the app’s simplicity.</p>
